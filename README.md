Code Icons
=====

Code Icons is an icon set of programming languages, frameworks, and coding tools.

> Note: All brand icons are trademarks of their respective owners. The use of these trademarks does not indicate endorsement of the trademark holder by me, nor vice versa.

TODOs:

- [ ] Add more icons (programming languages, frameworks, Operating Systems, services...)
- [ ] Add LESS and SCSS
- [ ] Add bower.json
